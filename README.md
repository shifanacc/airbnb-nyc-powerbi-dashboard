## About Airbnb
Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects property owners with travelers who are looking for short term accommodation. Hosts can list rooms, apartments, or entire homes for rent, and guests can book these properties based on price, location, availability, and reviews. Airbnb operates in many cities worldwide and generates large amounts of listing and review data that can be analyzed for pricing patterns, demand trends, and customer behavior.
### Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. The objective of the project is to analyze listing distribution, pricing patterns, availability, and review activity across different room types and neighborhood groups. The dashboard is designed to support exploratory data analysis and business insights through visual reporting.

### Dataset
The dataset used is AB_NYC_2019.csv containing Airbnb listing data for New York City. It includes information about room type, neighborhood, price, availability, host listings, and reviews.

### Data Preparation
The dataset was imported into Power BI and cleaned using Power Query. Error values and null values were handled appropriately. Data types were corrected for price, availability, and date fields. Unnecessary errors were removed and columns were formatted correctly for analysis. Aggregations such as average price, average availability, and total reviews were created.

### Dashboard Features
The report contains multiple pages with organized visuals.
Cards showing total listings, total reviews, average price, and average reviews per month.
Bar and column charts showing listings and prices by neighborhood and room type.
Donut chart showing room type distribution.
Map visual showing geographical spread of listings.
Area or line chart showing review trends over time.
Summary table showing room type with average price, average availability, and total reviews.
Slicers for room type, neighborhood group, and price range.
Buttons and bookmarks added for interaction and navigation.

### Key Insights
Entire home or apartment listings have the highest average price compared to other room types.
Private rooms have the largest share of total listings.
Manhattan and Brooklyn contain the majority of listings and higher average prices.
Listings with higher availability do not always have higher reviews.
Review activity varies across room types and locations.

### Tools Used
Power BI Desktop
Power Query for preprocessing
Data visualization and dashboard design features in Power BI

### Project Outcome
This dashboard demonstrates skills in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX measures, visualization design, and interactive reporting using Power BI. It can be used as a portfolio project to showcase Power BI analytics capability.
